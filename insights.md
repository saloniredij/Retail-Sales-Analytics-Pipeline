# Retail Analytics Project: Insights & Recommendations


I've analyzed the Online Retail dataset (UK transactions) to identify bestsellers and purchase patterns.

## 1. Key Business Insights

### 🕒 Peak Shopping Times
- **Busiest Hour**: 12:00 PM (Noon) is the absolute peak for sales revenue (£1.2M+).
- **Shopping Window**: 70% of daily sales occur between **10:00 AM and 3:00 PM**.
- **Quiet Times**: Sales drop significantly after 5:00 PM.

### 📅 Comparison by Day
- **Busiest Day**: Tuesday (£1.88M)
- **Runner Up**: Thursday (£1.79M)
- *Note: Saturday shows no sales in this dataset (likely closed).*

### 🏆 Top Bestsellers (Revenue)
1. **DOTCOM POSTAGE** (£206k)
2. **PAPER CRAFT , LITTLE BIRDIE** (£168k)
3. **REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER** (£142k)

## 2. Recommendation based on insights

> [!TIP]
> **Action**: Schedule promotional emails to arrive between **10:00 AM - 11:30 AM** on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
>
> **Why**: This ensures the message lands just before the peak shopping window of 12 PM, capturing customers when they are most active.
